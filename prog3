% Question 3: Coefficient of friction
% Given data
m = [2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 50]; % Masses in kg
F = [12.5, 23.5, 30, 61, 117, 294]; % Forces in N
g = 9.81; % Acceleration due to gravity in m/s^2

% Calculating the coefficient of friction for each test
mu = F ./ (m * g);

% Calculating the average coefficient of friction
mu_avg = mean(mu);

% Display results
fprintf('Coefficient of friction for each test: \n');
disp(mu);
fprintf('Average coefficient of friction: %.5f\n', mu_avg);
