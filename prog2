% Question 2: Temperature of the soda can after 3 hours
T0 = 120; % Initial temperature of the soda can in Fahrenheit
Ts = 38;  % Temperature of the refrigerator in Fahrenheit
k = 0.45; % Cooling constant
t = 3;    % Time in hours

% Newton's law of cooling formula
T = Ts + (T0 - Ts) * exp(-k * t);

% Display the result
fprintf('The temperature of the soda can after %.1f hours is %.2fÂ°F.\n', t, T);
